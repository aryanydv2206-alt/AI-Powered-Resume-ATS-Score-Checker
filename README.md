# AI-Powered-Resume-ATS-Score-Checker
This project aims to develop a web-based tool that analyzes resumes and evaluates their compatibility with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). The system will check formatting, keyword relevance, and structure to provide an overall ATS score. It will assist job seekers in optimizing their resumes for better shortlisting chances.
